## Lessons Learned

**What's Working:**
- Building skills incrementally vs waiting for full setup
- Telegram as reliable communication channel
- Apify for web scraping (reliable, scalable)
- Agent-browser for web automation

**Challenges:**
- Peekaboo permissions persistently blocked (use Steipete's brew install method)
- Instagram scraping blocked (use Apify workaround)
- Security audit needed (400+ malicious skills discovered)

**New Discoveries:**
- Steipete's CLI tools more reliable than browser automation
- LOBSTER better than bash hooks for workflows
- Moltbook = intelligence network for early trends
- GitClaw = zero-server deployment option

## Important Decisions

1. **Money-making is the metric** - Everything must have revenue path
2. **Security first** - Audit all skills before production use
3. **Token efficiency** - 70% cost reduction target through optimization
4. **Remote-first** - All work location-independent
