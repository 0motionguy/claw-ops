**Title:** OpenClaw Security Warning
**Topic:** Moltbot/OpenClaw security vulnerabilities and best practices

## Content Summary
**WARNING:** Most people should NOT be running Moltbot right now due to security vulnerabilities. Security researchers found hundreds of exposed instances leaking API keys, conversation histories, and allowing command execution on machines.

## 5 Critical Security Steps

### 1. **DO NOT Run on Main Machine**
- Use dedicated device
- Use separate email
- Use isolated accounts
- Limit blast radius if compromised

### 2. **Change Default Port (18789)**
- Shodan scanners find default ports in seconds
- Change to non-standard port immediately

### 3. **Configure gateway.trustedProxies**
- Without this, reverse proxy treats every connection as trusted
- Zero authentication required = major vulnerability

### 4. **Rotate ALL API Keys**
- If exposed for even a day, assume compromised
- Rotate immediately

### 5. **Vet Every Skill Before Installing**
- Researcher uploaded fake skill to MoltHub
- 16 real developers across 7 countries installed it within 8 hours
- Social engineering risk is real
