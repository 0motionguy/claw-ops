# 10-Tip Listicle Format

## Overview
The "10 Tips" format is proven viral content structure. Easy to consume, highly shareable, positions creator as expert.

## The Pattern
1. **Number** in title (5, 7, 10, 21)
2. **Promise** clear benefit
3. **Deliver** scannable list
4. **CTA** for deeper dive

## Examples from Analysis
- @ssssangha: "10 things to stop your CLAWDBOT getting hacked!"
- @adamstewartmarketing: "5 things you need to do immediately" (OpenClaw security)

## Why It Works
- Scannable (people skim)
- Completeness bias (want all tips)
- Shareable (save for later)
- Authority (I know 10 things)
- Actionable (doable steps)

## Number Psychology
- **3-5 tips:** Quick wins, high completion rate
- **7 tips:** "Magic number" for memory
- **10 tips:** Comprehensive but not overwhelming
- **21 tips:** Ultimate guide positioning
- **101 tips:** Encyclopedia/reference
