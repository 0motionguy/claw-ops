# Comment-For-Guide Lead Generation

## Overview
Instagram/TikTok lead generation strategy using "Comment X and I'll send you the guide" CTAs. Proven to drive high engagement and build qualified lead lists.

## The Pattern
1. **Hook** with valuable/problematic content
2. **CTA** "Comment '[KEYWORD]' and I'll send you the guide"
3. **Deliver** via DM with additional value
4. **Nurture** with follow-up content

## Examples from Analysis
