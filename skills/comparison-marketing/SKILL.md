# Comparison Marketing

Position your product by comparing it to established competitors.

## The Strategy

1. **Identify** competitor with brand recognition
2. **Compare** on specific dimension (price, speed, features)
3. **Prove** with evidence
4. **Convert** through clear positioning

## Comparison Angles

### 1. Price Comparison
**Template:** "Free [Your Product] vs $X/month [Competitor]"
- Free vs paid
- One-time vs subscription
- Open source vs proprietary

### 2. Feature Comparison
**Template:** "[Your Product] does [feature] that [Competitor] can't"
- Unique capabilities
- Better UX/UI
- More integrations

### 3. Philosophy Comparison
**Template:** "[Your approach] vs [Their approach]"
- Local-first vs cloud
- Privacy-first vs data-hungry
- Open vs closed

### 4. Performance Comparison
**Template:** "[X]% faster than [Competitor]"
- Speed benchmarks
- Accuracy metrics
- Resource usage

## Content Templates

```

## Risk Management

### Do:
- Use factual, provable statements
- Include "your results may vary"
- Acknowledge competitor strengths
- Focus on differentiation

### Don't:
- Use trademarks in ads
- Make false claims
- Attack personally
- Celebrate their failures

## Examples

**@hackonomics.ai:**
- Content: "This FREE Chinese Image Model is better Than NANO BANANA PRO"
- Angle: Free vs paid, quality comparison
- Hashtags: #ai #nanobanana #google

**Common Patterns:**
- "[X] vs [Y]: The Honest Comparison"
- "Why I switched from [X] to [Y]"
- "[X] alternative that [benefit]"

## Metrics

- Engagement on comparison content
- Website traffic from comparisons
- Conversion rate vs other channels
- Brand sentiment

## Best Practices

1. **Stay factual** — claims must be provable
2. **Be specific** — "faster" → "3x faster"
3. **Show don't tell** — side-by-side demos
4. **Update regularly** — features change
5. **Respond professionally** — to criticism
