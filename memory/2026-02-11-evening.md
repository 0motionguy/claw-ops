## Session Outcomes (Evening Update)

### COMPLETED
1. GitHub repo pushed — claw-ops live (secrets cleaned)
2. Task review finalized — comprehensive review saved
3. Claude Code Max clarified — Cannot use for OpenClaw (IDE-only)
4. OpenWork opportunity — 3M tokens + 30% revenue for OnlySwaps
5. Claude Code CLI Bridge — Created scripts/claude-cli-bridge.sh for Max plan integration

### CLAUDE CODE CLI BRIDGE (New)
- Created: scripts/claude-cli-bridge.sh
- Purpose: Use Claude Code CLI with Max plan instead of API calls
- Flow: OpenClaw → Bridge → Claude CLI → Max plan OAuth
- Status: Script ready, requires manual auth: `claude auth login`
- Limitation: Slower than API, no streaming, but uses subscription

### STILL PENDING
- Wallet keys for PolyClaw — Only remaining major blocker
- Claude CLI auth — Basil needs to run `claude auth login` manually

### Next Priorities
1. Wallet keys → Deploy PolyClaw trading
2. Start OnlySwaps integration (3M token bounty)
3. Test DROID hybrid Twitter workflow live
4. Test Claude CLI bridge after auth

---

*Session outcome: DROID operational, repo pushed, Claude CLI bridge ready, tasks finalized. Only wallet keys remain.*
